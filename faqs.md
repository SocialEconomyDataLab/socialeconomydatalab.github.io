## What is social finance and social investment?
Broadly, it is the investment of money with the aim of providing a social benefit, as well as an economic return.

Social investors usually provide finance to not-for-profit or impact-focussed organisations, such as charities, social enterprises, community businesses and co-operatives. Social dividends from these types of investment could include the creation of jobs in an economically disadvantaged area, provision of third-sector healthcare services to those in need, or producing goods with a limited negative impact on the environment.

Social investment differs from grantmaking in that money invested is recouped from recipients, usually with interest, and can be reinvested in other opportunities. Forms of social finance can include lending, share equity, crowdfunding and social impact bonds.

## What is open data?
> “Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose” [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/)

Open data enables wider reuse of important data. In the context of the social finance data standard, it allows appropriately licensed data to be used in numerous tools, applications and analysis.

As well as being published under terms that permit reuse, open data should be accessible (published online) and machine-readable (easy for computers to process). The benefits of this approach are that it enables the interoperability of various datasets, and therefore diverse systems and institutions can be made to work together using data.

## What is an open data specification?
It specifies a common data model and associated features, such as codelists and the use of identifiers, to achieve a higher degree of interoperability with open data.

Using a data specification ensures the harmonisation of datasets created by various publishers, and the consistent approach means that data users can be assured that they have data which makes it easier and more efficient to create, analyze and share information.
