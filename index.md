The Social Economy Data Lab aims to create a more informed and transparent social investment market in the UK, with better measurement of impact, increased lending efficiency and more strategic decision making.

Initiated by Power to Change, the project is working to:

*   Create a simple data **specification** to support social investors to create and share accessible, comparable and joined-up data on their investments;
*   Provide a **hub** with access to key datasets, accessible for re-use by researchers, investors, analysts and organisations seeking investment;
*   Support **skills** development around data management and use in the social investment field;

The project builds on learning from **[360Giving](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/)**, which has secured the publication of open data on over Â£11bn of grants from more than 50 different funders.

Social investment brings new challenges for publishers and users of data, but it is hoped that the sharing of knowledge and best practice will create better conditions for social investment.
