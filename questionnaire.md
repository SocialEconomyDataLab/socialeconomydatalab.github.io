We are exploring a new way of managing data gathering for applications to grant makers and social lenders. This approach aims to cut down on the duplication of data entry for applicant organisations by drawing on existing data that is already gathered using registration systems and compliance mechanisms for the Charity Commission, Companies House, FCA and inspectorates such as Ofsted and the Food Hygiene Agency.

We are also trialling the use of data that is held in private and proprietary systems which could cut down on time and effort expended through application processes, and also provide useful data to applicant organisations that would not otherwise be easily accessible. This trial will provide some of this kind of data, to show you what might be possible.

The following sets of questions are intended to be as minimal as possible, and to allow us to draw on data that is necessary to due diligence processes for both grants and social investment.

This information also allows us to access additional data beyond that held by government administration. This includes data sourced from Merchant ID numbers, and local economic data on spending in your local area.

For the purposes of this trial, we have also used invoice data that is already held by Key Fund. We are, however, testing access to this data using accounting software, and that is why we include questions about accounting software in this survey. You may receive some invoice data in the report, but this will not have been sourced from accounting software or from information provided in the survey for the moment.

By completing this form, you are giving us permission to analyse this data and provide it to you in a report, which will be presented to you for your feedback in the workshop at Key Fund on 22 May.

The data will not be shared beyond the team working on the Social Economy Data Trust. This team is made up of Power to Change, Key Fund, Open Data Services Cooperative, Gen Maitland Hudson and Ed Anderton. All data used in this trial will be stored and analysed in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation; you will see that we have included a privacy notice at the end of the survey, this is a test notice for the purposes of this trial.
