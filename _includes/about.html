              <p>The Social Economy Data Lab aims to create a more informed and transparent social investment market in the UK, with better measurement of impact, increased lending efficiency and more strategic decision making.</p>
              <p>Initiated by Power to Change, the project is working to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create a simple data <strong>specification</strong> to support social investors to create and share accessible, comparable and joined-up data on their investments;</li>
                <li>Provide a <strong>hub</strong> with access to key datasets, accessible for re-use by researchers, investors, analysts and organisations seeking investment;</li>
                <li>Support <strong>skills</strong> development around data management and use in the social investment field;</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The project builds on learning from <strong><a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/">360Giving</a></strong>, which has secured the publication of open data on over Â£11bn of grants from more than 50 different funders.</p>
              <p>Social investment brings new challenges for publishers and users of data, but it is hoped that the sharing of knowledge and best practice will create better conditions for social investment.</p>
