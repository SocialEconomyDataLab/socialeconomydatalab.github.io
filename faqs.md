## What is social finance and social investment?
Social investment it is the investment of money with the aim of providing a social benefit, as well as an economic return.

Social investors provide repayable finance to not-for-profit or impact-focussed organisations, such as charities, social enterprises, community businesses and co-operatives. Social dividends from these types of investment could include the creation of jobs in an economically disadvantaged area, provision of third-sector healthcare services to those in need, or producing goods with a limited negative impact on the environment.

Social investment differs from grantmaking in that money invested is recouped from recipients, usually with interest, and can be reinvested in other opportunities. Forms of social finance can include lending, share equity, crowdfunding and social impact bonds.

## What is open data?
> “Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose” [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/)

Open data enables wider reuse of important data. In the context of the social finance data standard, it allows appropriately licensed data to be used in numerous tools, applications and analysis.

As well as being published under terms that permit reuse, open data should be accessible (published online) and machine-readable (easy for computers to process). The benefits of this approach are that it enables the interoperability of various datasets, and therefore diverse systems and institutions can be made to work together using data.

## What is an open data specification?
An open data specification specifies a common data model and associated features, such as codelists and the use of identifiers, to achieve a higher degree of interoperability with open data.

Data has massive potential across many domains to bring better understanding and the ability to address challenges and opportunities. Where data on social investment exists, it is often held in silos (usually within organisation that has created it). The value of already existing data can be increased and turned into useful information through standardisation.

Using a data specification ensures the harmonisation of datasets created by various publishers, and the consistent approach means that data users can be assured that they have data which makes it easier and more efficient to create, analyze and share information.

## Why is an open data spec needed for social investment?
Social finance and social investment are relatively new fields with burgeoning markets and an increasing policy focus.

Previous work has attempted to profile and measure the size of the social investment market, but much is still unknown about how social finance is being used and what its impact is. It remains difficult to access and use data effectively when it is published sporadically, in different formats, and without a common or consistent model.

Developing a domain-specific open data specification for social investment seeks to unlock the potential of the data currently being collected on social investment. Involving the institutions themselves in the development will ensure a useful and usable data specification which meets the needs of the social finance market.

## Who can take part in the Social Investment Data Labs?
Involvement in the Social Investment Data Labs is open and welcome to anyone with social finance data to share or use.

We want to develop the specification through an open process with the involvement of players throughout the social finance market. We want to hear from you so please contact us to let us know about your interest.
